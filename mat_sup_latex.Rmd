\subsubsection{Visualization of model estimates with and without outliers}

\vspace{1cm}

```{r outliers_model_plt, fig.cap = "Contrast of model estimates obtained with meta-regression analysis over the full dataset (yellow) and over the dataset with outliers removed (blue). Estimates are represented with circles and corresponding 95% confidence intervals with horizontal lines. Each estimate corresponds to the additive effect when a moderator level is replaced in the intercept (e.g. ADI is the additive effect of ADI when ADI is put as intercept instead of ACI). Estimated effect sizes whose 95% confidence intervals do not overlap zero (black vertical line) indicate a positive correlation between acoustic indices and diversity if they are to the right of zero, or a negative correlation if they are to the left of zero. We considered outliers every study that had a Cookâ€™s distance value higher than the mean of all Cook distances. Model moderators were acoustic indices (ADI, AEI, AR, BIO, H, NDSI, with ACI as intercept), diversity metric (Species abundance, Species diversity, Abundance of sounds, with Species richness as intercept), environment (Aquatic, with Terrestrial as intercept), diversity source (Acoustic, with Non-Acoustic as intercept). The solid vertical black line represents a null effect size."}
